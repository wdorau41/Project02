  <h1>Welcome to my Home Page</h1>
    <h2>I'm Walter Dorau and this is my Project 02 for ITMD361 </h2>
      <p>If youn want to learn a bit more about me above will take you to a Bio page,
         and If you want to see my work experiences, skills, etc. (or lack there of) I've got another page detailed with that
      </p>
      <h3>My Thoughts on the project </h3>
        <p>I did not know what else to put here so I give some thoughts on this first project.
           Firstly, I thought it was an enjoyable experience to make up a simple website from scratch.
           I did not find it too hard to accomplish but it was still a good test of my current knowledge in coding in HTML.
           So far HTML has been one of my favorite things to program in, and look forward to the next two projects, and learning CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
      <h3>My two questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Is there a way to only edit css parameters of my ol and li in my nav tag? I ended up having to change some items to different list types so the formatting only changed the wanted portions.
          </li>
          <li>Is there another way to add images, because mine do not load with my current declaration?</li>
        </ul>
