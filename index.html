      <h4>My Thoughts on the project </h4>
        <p>I did not know what else to put here so I give some thoughts on this first project.
           Firstly, I thought it was an enjoyable experience to make up a simple website from scratch.
           I did not find it too hard to accomplish but it was still a good test of my current knowledge in coding in HTML.
           So far HTML has been one of my favorite things to program in, and look forward to the next two projects, and learning CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

      <h4>My two questions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Should I have used a header for my navigation or jut included it at the top of my body clause,
              and are there any other ways that you can make a "navigation bar" in compliance with HTML5?
          </li>
          <li>Is there any way through HTML that you can autoplay media such as an embedded video/song when you open up the webpage or is that something you would achieve through using Java Script?</li>
        </ul>
